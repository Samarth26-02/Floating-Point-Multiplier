# Floating Point Multiplier Project

## üìù Overview
This repository contains my Floating Point Multiplier project implemented in Verilog, complete with test benches and project documentation.

##  Contents
- **Verilog source files** (test benches, synthesis scripts, etc.) located in the `FPMCD/` folder.
- **Final project report & related documentation** in PDF/DOCX formats.
- **README.md** ‚Äî this file.

##  Technologies & Tools
- **Hardware Description Language:** Verilog
- **Simulation & Verification:** Cadence Virtuoso (for functional validation)
- **Synthesis Tool:** Cadence Genus (using TCL & SDC scripts)
- **Design Features:** Carry bypass adder, Kogge-Stone adder, Wallace Tree multiplier ‚Äî optimized for area, power, and performance.

##  Project Highlights
- Designed a floating-point multiplier combining high-performance arithmetic modules.
- Verified design correctness using structured test benches in Cadence Virtuoso.
- Automated synthesis with scripts to generate gate-level implementation in Cadence Genus.
